```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### 1. LLM-Powered Memory Extraction

The system now uses intelligent LLM extraction for facts and preferences:

```python
# Intelligent fact extraction using LLM
extraction_result = extract_facts_and_preferences(conversation)

# Returns structured information:
{
    "facts": ["Sarah is a software engineer at Google"],
    "preferences": ["Sarah loves hiking and photography"],
    "entities": ["Sarah", "Google", "hiking", "photography"],
    "importance_score": 0.8,
    "confidence": 0.9
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Structured Extraction**: LLM identifies facts, preferences, and entities
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each extraction includes confidence levels
- **Importance Assessment**: Automatic importance scoring for memories
- **Entity Recognition**: Tracks people, places, and things mentioned

### 2. Dynamic Memory Operations

The system can intelligently decide memory operations:

```python
# LLM determines appropriate operations
operations = determine_memory_operations(new_facts, existing_memories)

# Operations include:
# - ADD: New information
# - UPDATE: Modifies existing memory
# - DELETE: Contradicts and replaces
# - NONE: Already present or irrelevant
```

### 3. Advanced Multi-Factor Relevance Scoring

Enhanced retrieval with sophisticated scoring:

```python
# Multi-factor relevance calculation
final_score = (
    semantic_score * 0.4 +      # 40% semantic similarity
    recency_score * 0.2 +       # 20% recency (30-day decay)
    access_bonus * 0.1 +        # 10% access frequency
    type_weight * 0.2 +         # 20% memory type (preference > fact > conversation)
    confidence_score * 0.1      # 10% extraction confidence
) * importance_multiplier
```

**Scoring Factors:**
- **Semantic Similarity**: Vector similarity between query and memory
- **Temporal Relevance**: Exponential decay based on memory age
- **Access Frequency**: Bonus for frequently accessed memories
- **Memory Type Weighting**: Preferences and facts weighted higher
- **Confidence Scoring**: Higher confidence in LLM extractions
- **Importance Multiplier**: User-defined importance levels

### 4. Enhanced Embedding Model

Upgraded to Ollama's nomic-embed-text for better semantic understanding:

```python
# Configuration
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "nomic-embed-text"  # 768 dimensions
DIMENSIONS = 768  # vs 384 in all-MiniLM-L6-v2

# Benefits:
# - Better semantic understanding
# - Consistent with LLM provider
# - Higher dimensional space
# - Improved similarity matching
```

### 5. Intelligent Memory Context Assembly

Enhanced context building with scoring information:

```python
# Enhanced memory context with scoring
context = [
    "1. [PREFERENCE - 0.85] Sarah loves hiking and photography",
    "   Entities: Sarah, hiking, photography",
    "2. [FACT - 0.78] Sarah is a software engineer at Google",
    "   Entities: Sarah, Google, software engineer"
]
```

## üß™ Testing Enhanced Memory

The enhanced system demonstrates intelligent memory processing:

### Session 1: Intelligent Profile Building
```python
agent1 = MemoryAgent("user_123")

# LLM extracts facts and preferences automatically
agent1.process_user_input("Hi! My name is Sarah and I'm a software engineer at Google")
# Extracts: fact="Sarah is a software engineer at Google", entities=["Sarah", "Google"]

agent1.process_user_input("I love hiking and photography, especially landscape photography")
# Extracts: preference="loves hiking and photography", entities=["hiking", "photography"]

agent1.process_user_input("I prefer moderate difficulty trails and I'm allergic to peanuts")
# Extracts: preferences=["prefers moderate trails", "allergic to peanuts"]
```

### Session 2: Advanced Memory Recall
```python
agent2 = MemoryAgent("user_123")  # Same user, new session

# Advanced retrieval with multi-factor scoring
agent2.process_user_input("What's my name and what do I do?")
# Retrieves with high relevance: "Sarah is a software engineer at Google"

agent2.process_user_input("What are my hobbies and preferences?")
# Retrieves preferences with temporal and importance weighting
```

### Session 3: Memory Operations
```python
agent3 = MemoryAgent("user_123")

# LLM determines this updates existing preference
agent3.process_user_input("I've changed my mind - I prefer easy trails now")
# Operation: UPDATE existing "moderate trails" preference
```
